  "summary": "The diff implements frontend-only admin gating for Leads: it adds an isCallerAdmin query hook, hides Leads entry points in the AppShell and LoginPage for non-admins, and adds a non-admin \"Not Authorized\" state on the Leads page (with navigation support via App.tsx passing onNavigate). Some additional UI (connection loading/error screens and a Share dialog) appears to have been added that was not requested.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added global loading and backend connection error screens (with retry and help phone link) in App root.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is specifically about restricting Leads visibility/access for non-admins; it does not request new connection loading/error UX.",

      "description": "Added a Share dialog/button in the AppShell header (ShareAppLinkCard-based sharing UI).",
