However, the diff also includes unrelated URL-parameter/deep-link utility changes that were not requested and touch a stated non-goal area (link-sharing/deep-linking features).",

      "description": "Additional URL parameter utilities related to session persistence/secret parameter handling and a new deep-link parameter helper (customer booking deep-links).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly states adding new authentication or link-sharing features is a non-goal and the only requirement is to fix the Trip Total Calculator behavior. The diff shows non-calculator changes in URL/deep-link utilities.",
